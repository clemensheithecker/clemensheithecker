### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am Clemensâ€”a programming and software engineering enthusiast ready to make an impact in the world of technology. I had always been passionate about computers and tech, but my fascination for building with code started during my undergraduate economics program. I enjoyed programming for my studies' statistical, modeling, and visualization work. I tried to use code wherever I could, which inspired me to learn more. I taught myself the basics of web development and built myself a [portfolio website](https://clemensheithecker.com/) using _React_, _NextJS_, and _Tailwind_.

Currently, I am gaining my first professional experience with web technologies as an IT intern at Douglas. There, I independently implemented [Spotify Backstage](https://backstage.io/) as a heterogeneous developer platform used as a central hub across all IT and engineering teams. I integrated user and group authentication, management, and permission systems and connected Backstage to other services via plugins, e.g. Kubernetes, Grafana, Lighthouse, and Prometheus.

I also contributed to the Spotify Backstage **open-source community** by writing and publishing two plugins as npm packages:

- [`@parfuemerie-douglas/scaffolder-backend-module-azure-pipelines`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@parfuemerie-douglas/scaffolder-backend-module-azure-pipelines)` adds scaffolder actions to _build_, _run_, and _authorize_ Azure DevOps pipelines in Backstage.
- [`@parfuemerie-douglas/scaffolder-backend-module-azure-repositories`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@parfuemerie-douglas/scaffolder-backend-module-azure-repositories) adds scaffolder actions to _clone_ and _push to_ Azure DevOps remote repositories in Backstage.

Next, I want to continue focusing on software engineering and web development. **I am looking for an exciting opportunity to put my software engineering skills to work.**

### Projects

I also have strong data processing, analysis, and communication skills. Here is a selection of my recent projects in which I applied my data science skills:

- [`Machine Learning Clickbait Headline Classification`](https://github.com/clemensheithecker/clickbait-headline-classification) â€” Detection of clickbait in headlines via natural language processing using _Python_ and _NLTK_.
- [`NYC Bike Sharing Database`](https://github.com/clemensheithecker/nyc-bike-sharing) â€” Analysis of ride-sharing patterns based on the weather using _MySQL_, _Python_, and _Seaborn_.
- [`European EV Market Performance Dashboard`](https://github.com/clemensheithecker/ev-market-europe) â€” Data sourcing, forecasting, and visualization using _MS Excel_ and _Power BI_.
- [`Data Visualization of Demographic Change in Germany`](https://github.com/clemensheithecker/demographic-change-germany) â€” Data transformation and visualization using _R_ and _Tidyverse_.

Whilst studying at university, I gained my first web development experiences and completed freeCodeCamp's [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/clemensheithecker/responsive-web-design) and [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/clemensheithecker/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures) certificates.

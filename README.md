### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Clemensâ€”a data and programming enthusiast ready to put my data wrangling, visualization, and modeling skills to work. My fascination with data exploration, regression analysis, and machine learning models inspired me to follow [DataCamp's Data Scientist with Python career track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python) next to my studies.

Currently, I am finalizing my bachelor of science degree in economics as an international student at [Tilburg University](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/education/bachelors-programs/economics) in the Netherlands. Before starting a master's in data science, **I am looking for an exciting opportunity to put my data wrangling, visualization, and modeling skills to work.**

### Projects

Here is a selection of my recent projects in which I applied my data science skills:

- [`Machine Learning Clickbait Headline Classification`](https://github.com/clemensheithecker/clickbait-headline-classification) â€” Detection of clickbait in headlines via natural language processing using *Python* and *NLTK*.
- [`NYC Bike Sharing Database`](https://github.com/clemensheithecker/nyc-bike-sharing) â€” Analysis of ride-sharing patterns based on the weather using *MySQL*, *Python*, and *Seaborn*.
- [`European EV Market Performance Dashboard`](https://github.com/clemensheithecker/ev-market-europe) â€” Data sourcing, forecasting, and visualization using *MS Excel* and *Power BI*.
- [`Data Visualization of Demographic Change in Germany`](https://github.com/clemensheithecker/demographic-change-germany) â€” Data transformation and visualization using *R* and *Tidyverse*.

I also have some experience in web development and completed freeCodeCamp's [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/clemensheithecker/responsive-web-design) and [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/clemensheithecker/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures) certificates.
